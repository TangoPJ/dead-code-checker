`Dead Code Checker` is a tool for finding dead code in your JavaScript or TypeScript project. It helps to ensure a cleaner and more maintainable code base.

The tool will recursively scan through your project's source files and generate a report of unused functions and variables.

## Features

- `Variable Detection:` Detects declared variables and verifies their usage.
- `Function Detection:` Identifies declared functions and checks if they are used across your project.
- `Support any framework:` React, Angular, Vue, and more.
- `Detailed Report:` Provides a detailed report of unused functions and variables, including the file and line number where they are declared.

## Installation

You can install Dead Code Checker using npx:

```bash
npx dead-code-checker
```

To use Dead Code Checker, simply run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npx dead-code-checker -f ./src
```

| Option | Args | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -h, --help | null | Show all options. |
| -v, --version | null | **Display Application Version:** Displays the current version of the application. |
| -f, --folder <folder> | ./src | **Folder to be scanned:** Folder to be scanned (Default: ./src) |
| -if, --ignoreFolders <folders...> | node_modules dist | **Folders to be ignored:** Folders to be ignored |

## Example Output

| üìÅ File                              | üî¢ Line |    üîç Name |
| ------------------------------------ | :-----: | ---------: |
| /path/to/your/project/src/oneFile.js |   17    | myFunction |
| /path/to/your/project/src/twoFile.js |    4    | myVariable |

If no unused functions or variables are found, you'll see a message like this:

```bash
‚úÖ No dead code found!
```
