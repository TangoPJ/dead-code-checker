`Dead Code Checker` is a tool for finding dead code in your JavaScript or TypeScript project. It helps to ensure a cleaner and more maintainable code base.

## How it works

The tool will recursively scan through your project's source files and generate a report of unused functions and variables.

## Features

- `Variable Detection:` Detects declared variables and verifies their usage.
- `Function Detection:` Identifies declared functions and checks if they are used across your project.
- `Support any framework:` React, Angular, Vue, and more.
- `Detailed Report:` Provides a detailed report of unused functions and variables, including the file and line number where they are declared.

## Installation

You can install Dead Code Checker using npx:

```bash
npx dead-code-checker
```

To use Dead Code Checker, simply run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npx dead-code-checker -f ./src
```

| Option | Args | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -h, --help | null | Show all options. |
| -v, --version | null | Displays the current version of the application. |
| -f, --folder | folder/app | Folder to be scanned (Default: ./src) |
| -in, --ignoreNames | funcName | Function or variable names to be ignored |
| -if, --ignoreFolders | folderName | Folders to be ignored |

## Example Output

If no unused functions or variables are found, you'll see a message like this:

```bash
âœ… No dead code found!
```

## Use as API

To use Dead Code Checker as an API, you can import the `DeadCodeChecker` class from the `dead-code-checker` module.

```javascript
const DeadCodeChecker = require('dead-code-checker');

const checker = new DeadCodeChecker('src/', {
  ignoreNames: ['foo', 'bar'],
  ignoreFolders: ['tests']
});

const report = checker.run();

console.log(report);
```
